# Speech-Emotion-Detection-Project
- This project is a complete end-to-end Speech Emotion Recognition system that classifies    human emotions from audio recordings using machine learning. The system includes:
    1. A trained deep learning model to recognize emotions from audio
    2. A Flask-based web application with endpoints for uploading audio and receiving predictions
    3. A frontend interface to interact with the system

🧠 Model Details
- Input: .wav audio file (up to 4 seconds)
- Feature Extraction: 40 MFCCs with fixed length (173 frames)
- Model Type: Hybrid Model CNN+BiLSTM
- Output Classes:
    1. Angry
    2. Calm
    3. Disgust
    4. Fearful
    5. Happy
    6. Neutral
    7. Sad
    8. Surprised

🌐 Web Application Features
- Upload an audio file and get emotion prediction
- Confidence score for the predicted emotion
- Beautifully designed frontend pages:
    1. Home
    2. Technical Details
    3. Demo
    4. About

🎧 How it Works
- User uploads a .wav audio file through the web interface.
- Flask (app.py):
    1. Saves and preprocesses the audio (MFCC feature extraction)
    2. Loads the trained model and makes predictions
    3. Returns emotion and confidence
    4. Results are displayed on the frontend.

📊 Model Training
- The model was trained using MFCC features extracted from labeled datasets (e.g., RAVDESS, CREMA-D). Training includes:
- Balancing dataset 
- Data augmentation
- Normalization
- Stratified splits
- Early stopping and tuning

🎯Accuracy
Test Accuracy: 94.48%
